# LLM-Based Bias Detection in Academic Writing

## 📌 Project Overview
Bias in academic writing can influence decision-making, research outcomes, and the fairness of scientific communication. This project proposes an **LLM-based Bias Detection System** that automatically identifies different forms of bias in academic text, including:

- Linguistic Bias  
- Gender Bias  
- Racial/Ethnicity Bias  
- Citation Bias  
- Methodological Bias  

The system is designed as a research-focused tool to help students, researchers, and academic editors produce more **fair, inclusive, and unbiased** academic content.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect different types of bias in academic writing using Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Analyze bias patterns in research articles and academic datasets.
- Train and fine-tune transformer models for bias classification.
- Develop a bias scoring and explainability mechanism.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for testing bias in input text.

## 🧠 Proposed Methodology

1. **Data Collection**
   - Datasets: `rt-realtoxicity`, `rt-inod-bias`, and semi-synthetic bias datasets.
   - Additional academic text from open-source journal articles.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Text cleaning
   - Tokenization
   - Label normalization
   - Bias category tagging

3. **Model Selection**
   - Primary model: **DeBERTa-v3-small**
   - Other tested LLMs: LLaMA2, Mistral, GPT-based prompts (optional)

4. **Training & Fine-Tuning**
   - Fine-tune DeBERTa on labeled bias datasets.
   - Optimize using cross-entropy loss with class weighting.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Fairness metrics for subgroup analysis

6. **Output**
   - Bias label prediction
   - Bias confidence score
   - Category-wise bias visualization
